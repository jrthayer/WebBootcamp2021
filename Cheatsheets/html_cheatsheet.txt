    Comments: <!-- comment text -->

    HTML 5: is the latest version of html that comes with new 
        elements and also new features that aren't just additions to the core elements of HTML.

    Reserved Characters: characters reserved by html like <,>. In order to use reserved characters you need to use entity codes(< == &lt;)

    Semantic Markup: role does the html element have? 
        -Semantic: relating to meaning
        -The idea is to use meaning html elements to help users determine the role of the element from the type of element.
        -This helps with screen readers and site crawlers
        -Example elements:
            +The elements below are all functionally the same as a div
            but gives meaning to the markup through their standardized use.
            +<main> specifies the main content of a document
            +<nav> defines a set of navigation links. NOT all links of a document only major blocks of navigation links.
            +<section> defines a section in a document.
            +<article> independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.
            +<aside> defines some content aside from the content it is placed in. The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
            +<header> represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.
            +<footer> defines a footer for a document or section.
            +<time> defines a specific time (or datetime). The datetime attribute of this element is used translate the time into a machine-readable format.
            +<figure>  tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

VS Code:
    -Emmet:

        + > == create nested elements (section > h1 > div: create a section element with a h1 inside which has a div inside)
        + + == create elements that are siblings(section > h1 + div: create a section with an h1 and div child)
        + * == create multiple instances of an element( h1 * 5: creates 5 h1 elements)
