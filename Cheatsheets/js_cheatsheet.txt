    Primitives:
        +number: js has only ONE number type.
            +doesn't matter if the number is whole, floating, negative, or positive
            +there is a limit of memory a number can take up
            +js mathmatically follows order of operations(PEMDAS)
            + x ** y = x to the power of y
            +NaN = Not a Number(is a valid number VALUE). 
                +represents a result that is not a number.
                + examples ---> 0/0 = NaN. 1 + NaN = NaN.
        +string: 
        +boolean: true or false.
        +null 
        +undefined

    Variables: references a value with a name.
            +example var Name = value;
        +Defined with var, let, or const data type.
            +var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
                It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined 
                throughout the program as compared to let.
            +const works like let but CANNOT change value;
            +let and const are the newer types, var does not need to be used
        +variables are not type set! Any variable can be any value. 
            +This includes things like functions!?!
        +naming convertions
            +variable names cannot start with a number. 
            +camelCase
            +snake_case
