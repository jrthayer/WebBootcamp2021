    Primitives:
        +number: js has only ONE number type.
            +doesn't matter if the number is whole, floating, negative, or positive
            +there is a limit of memory a number can take up
            +js mathmatically follows order of operations(PEMDAS)
            + x ** y = x to the power of y
            +NaN = Not a Number(is a valid number VALUE). 
                +represents a result that is not a number.
                + examples ---> 0/0 = NaN. 1 + NaN = NaN.
        +string:
            +format: need to be wrapped in " " or ' '.
            +numbers inside '' are a string not a number.
                +var x = "22" + "33" ---->> "2233"
            +to use quotes inside a string use the other ""/''
                +var quote = 'she said, "hello!"'
            +strings are indexed. every character in the string has an index.
                +index starts at 0
                +var cat = "Felix"; cat[1] ---> "e";
                +.length returns the number of indexes. .length is a property.
                +string methods: built in string actions
                    +format: stringName.methodName()
                +string template literals: allow strings to have embedded expressions!
                    +have to use `` as the string quotes
                    +expression format: ${expression}
                    +examples:
                        +`I have ${5+6} cups` --> "I have 11 cups"
        +boolean: true or false.
        +null:
            +"Intentional absence of any value"
            + must be assigned!!!
        +undefined
            +variables that do not have an assigned value

    Variables: references a value with a name.
            +example var Name = value;
        +Defined with var, let, or const data type.
            +var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
                It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined 
                throughout the program as compared to let.
            +const works like let but CANNOT change value;
            +let and const are the newer types, var does not need to be used
        +variables are not type set! Any variable can be any value. 
            +This includes things like functions!?!
        +naming convertions
            +variable names cannot start with a number. 
            +camelCase
            +snake_case
    
    Math Object: is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Itâ€™s not a function object.
        Math works with the Number type. It doesn't work with BigInt.
