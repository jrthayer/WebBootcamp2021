CSS(Cascading Style Sheets): the adjectives of web development. Provides 
    the visual represntation of the document.

    css Rules: basic pattern that defines css. (template below)
        +template: selector{
                        property: value;
                    }
        +syntax: semicolons need to be after all proper decleration!
        +casscade: styles are applied top down so styles applied or linked first 
            will be overridden by styles further down if specificity is equivalent. 
        +specificity: this is how browsers determine which selector should be applied
            when multiple selectors affect an element.
            +specificity calculation: 
                !important>inline>id>class,attribute,psuedoClass>type,psuedoElement
                +when specifcity is the same order matters. Last style defined is applied.    
        +inderitance: SOME css styles will be inherited by children if it isn't 
            defined by the child
            +values are inderited from closest relative.
            +keyword inherit is used to force a child to inherit values that 
                aren't done by default
            +
    Ways to include css:
        +inline: defined in html style attribute.(Very Few Use cases)
        +nested: defined in html tag element <style>
        +external: write styles in a .css file and include it with a <link> element
            in the head of the html document.(Standard Practice)

    Selectors:
        +types:
            +*{}: universal selector. 
                +selects all elments of a document.
            +element{}: element selector. 
                +style all instances of element selected. (h1, div, etc)
            +#idName{}: id selector. 
                +style unique element with idName value.
                +need # before name to indicate this is an id.
                +id should only be referencing one item on the pages
            +.className{}: class selector. 
                +apply style to all elements that have a class attribute
                    equivalent to className.
                +need . before className
                +className can/should be set on multiple elements
        +combinators:
            +selector , selector{}: 
                +apply styles to multiple selectors at once that are seperated
                    by a , .
            +selector selector{}: descendant selector.
                +select all elements that are inside the first selector
                    and match the second selector.
                +example: div a{}: select all a elements inside a div element
                +most commonly used with .class element{}
            +selector + selector{}: adjacent selector
                +select only elements that match the second selector that are 
                    immediately after elements that match the first selector
                +example: h1+p{}: select all p elements immediately after an h1 element
            +selector > selector{}: direct child selector
                + example div > p{}: select all p elements that are direct children
                of div elements. 
            +selector[attribute=value]{}: attribute selector.
                +input[type="radio"]{}: selects all input elements with type = radio. 
                +more types of this selector: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors
        +pseudo classes: added to selectors for special states
            +selector:hover{}: element selected when cursor is over that element
            +selector:active{}: active selected element
                +examples: holding a click on it
            +selector:checked{} element selected that is checked
                +example: radio button that is clicked on
            +selector:nth-of-type(){} select specific instance of elements being selected.
                +example: h1:nth-of-type(2){} select second h1
                +example: h1:nth-of-type(3n){} select every third h1
        +pseudo elements: styles a specific part of an element
            +suppose to have :: but : does work and is often used mistakenly
            +selector::first-letter{} changes first character of each selected element.
            +selector::first-line{} "" first line ""
            +selector::selection{}change style when selector is being selected
            +selector::before{} creates a pseudo element before the selected element
            +selector::after{} "" after ""
    
    Properties:
        +color props:

            +text-align: determine text orientation
            +font-weight: determineds text thickness depicted with words or numbers.

            +line-height: determines height of line of text. 
                (example line-height: 2 would result in double spaced text)

            +font-family: sets font of text. 
                +can list several fonts in case the first font isn't available on the machine

            +value of each channel can range from 0-255
        +hexadecimal: still rgb but represents 0-255 using hex numbering
            +example #ff03ab(red=ff,blue=03,green=ab)
            +most commonly used color indicator
            + single digit hexvalues are valid if each first number of each channel 
            is the same as their second. example(#fa4 == #ffaa44)
