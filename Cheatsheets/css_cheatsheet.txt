CSS(Cascading Style Sheets): the adjectives of web development. Provides 
    the visual represntation of the document.

    css Rules: basic pattern that defines css. (template below)
        +template: selector{
                        property: value;
                    }
        +syntax: semicolons need to be after all proper decleration!

    Ways to include css:
        +inline: defined in html style attribute.(Very Few Use cases)
        +nested: defined in html tag element <style>
        +external: write styles in a .css file and include it with a <link> element
            in the head of the html document.(Standard Practice)

    Properties:
        +color props:
            +background: modifies element background, does more than color.
            +background-color: sets background color.
            +color: changes text color.
        +text:
            +font-size: determines font size of text
                +size units:
                    +px = pixel. Doesn't necessarily equal width of eactly 1px
            +text-align: determine text orientation
            +font-weight: determineds text thickness depicted with words or numbers.
                +400 = normal, 700 = bold
            +text-decoration: adds a line to text
                +options:
                    +-line:orientation of line.(under, over, through)
                    +-color: color of line.
                    +-style: type of line(dashed, double, wavy)
                    +-thickness: thickness of line
            +line-height: determines height of line of text. 
                (example line-height: 2 would result in double spaced text)
            +letter-spacing: determines space between characters
            +font-family: sets font of text. 
                +can list several fonts in case the first font isn't available on the machine
                +fonts can be linked to pages with a font file

    
    css Colors:
        +named: 140 colors have an english name associated with them.
        +rgb(red,green,blue): additive color system
            +has three color channels(in order): red, green, blue
            +value of each channel can range from 0-255
        +hexadecimal: still rgb but represents 0-255 using hex numbering
            +example #ff03ab(red=ff,blue=03,green=ab)
            + single digit hexvalues are valid if each first number of each channel 
            is the same as their second. example(#fa4 == #ffaa44)
